What is MarsSI?
---------------

MarsSI (Acronym of MARS Information System) is a web Geographic Information System 
application which allows the managing and processing of Martian orbital data. 

From this application, the user is able to easily and rapidly select observations, 
to process raw data via proposed automatic pipelines and to get back final 
products which can be visualized under GIS application like ARCGIS and QGIS. 
Moreover MarsSI also proposes an automatic stereo-restitution pipeline in order 
to produce Digital Terrain Models (DTM). 


How to use MarsSI?
------------------

MarsSI's interface is built on [Geomajas](http://www.geomajas.org/), an open source web GIS 
application framework. It shows MOLA or THEMIS global maps of Mars and ground footprints of 
martian missions remote-sensing instruments.

In order to obtain a map-projected raster file, user only needs to select and add 
footprints into his cart and launch the dedicated process with just one button. Processed
data can be accessed via ftp.

Documentation and video tutorials are available at [this adress](http://emars.univ-lyon1.fr/ContactUs/About.jsp)


Which data is available in MarsSI?
----------------------------------

Data available in MarsSI comes from the last 3 orbiters around Mars. 
Data is downloaded from the [NASA Planetary Data Server](https://pds.nasa.gov/) (PDS) and processed 
with several software like [USGS ISIS3](https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/), [ENVI IDL](http://www.exelisvis.fr/), [AMES Stereo Pipeline](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/)...

###Mission , instruments and highest level of processing###
* __Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter (MRO)__
	* CTX: Map-projected calibrated raster and Stereo-restitute DTM
	* HiRISE: Map-projected calibrated raster and Stereo-restitute DTM
	* CRISM: Map-projected calibrated raster with spectral parameters

* __Mars Explorer (MEX)__
	* HRSC: Map-projected calibrated raster and Stereo-restitute DTM created by HRSC team
	* OMEGA: Raw data

* __Mars Odyssey (ODY)__
	* THEMIS: Raw data

Stereo-restitution
------------------

The stereo-restitution pipeline is functional for HiRISE and CTX images. CTX and HiRISE possible DTM footprints are computed, according to the following constraints: image couples with 60% width-overlapping and a minimum deviation of 5° in emission angle. It is user’s responsibility to check the quality of the stereo pairs, thanks to their PDS on-line label files. Then, the user can choose one or several stereo footprints from the map view and they appear in the stereo-restitution view. If the raw image couple is not stored on the local server, MarsSI automatically adds the 2 images to the user’s cart and ask him to process the data before launching the stereo-restitution application. The script pipeline uses the [Ames Stereo Pipeline toolkit](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/) to process the stereo images and automatically obtain DTM.

Above figure shows examples of DEMs generated by MarsSI and compared with lower resolution DEMs. The top images show the same area (inside Oyama crater) with DEMs from HiRISE, superposed on CTX, superposed on HRSC on the left, and on the right the same HiRISE DEM with transparency on its associated orthoimage, superposed on the MOLA DEM with transparency on the THEMIS IR daytime mosaic. The north-south with line indicates the location of the elevation profiles. The bottom images show close-ups on the HiRISE DEM and its associated orthoimage, and a shaded relief from the same DEM.(HRSC DEM from the HRSC MC-11 (East) DEM mosaic, CTX DEM from orbits 007388 and 024912, HiRISE DEM and orthoimage from orbits 037505 and 037993). 

The limits between the different DEMs are still slightly visible due to differences in resolution that lead to high resolution elevation differences pixel to pixel, to edge effects, and to slight horizontal shifts between datasets. However the high-resolution DEMs fit in very well inside the low resolution one.
