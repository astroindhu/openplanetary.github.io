What is MarsSI?
---------------

MarsSI (Acronym of MARS Information System) is a web Geographic Information System 
application which allows the managing and processing of Martian orbital data. 

From this application, the users is able to easily and rapidly select observations, 
to process raw data via proposed automatic pipelines and to get back final 
products which can be visualized under GIS application like ARCGIS and QGIS. 
Moreover MarsSI also proposes an automatic stereo-restitution pipeline in order 
to produce Digital Terrain Models (DTM). 


How to use MarsSI?
------------------

MarsSI's interface is built on [Geomajas](http://www.geomajas.org/), an open source web GIS 
application framework. It shows MOLA or THEMIS global maps of Mars and ground footprints of 
martian missions remote-sensing instruments.

In order to obtain a map-projected raster file, user only needs to select and add 
footprints into his cart and launch the dedicated process with just one button. Processed
data can be accessed via ftp.

Documentation and video tutorial are available at [this adress](http://emars.univ-lyon1.fr/ContactUs/About.jsp)


Which data is available in MarsSI?
----------------------------------

Data available in MarsSI comes from the last 3 orbiters around Mars. 
Data is downloaded from the [NASA Planetary Data Server](https://pds.nasa.gov/) and processed 
with several software like USGS ISIS3, ENVI IDL, AMES Stereo Pipeline...
