## VESPA: Why would you care?

Modern ground based and space borne instruments produce huge datasets, 
especially on long-lived missions such as Mars-Express. This calls for new 
ways to handle the data, not only to perform massive processing, but also more 
basically to access them easily and efficiently. Planetary science will be 
facing big data challenges and opportunities in these years.

## VESPA: What is this?

Virtual Observatory (VO) techniques developed in Astronomy during the past 
15 years can be adapted to address this problem, provided they are extended to 
include specificities of Solar System studies such as coordinate systems, 
target-related time scales, or measured quantities.

An effort to adapt VO techniques to Solar System studies has been started in 
the frame of the Europlanet program, first in FP7 (2009-2012) as a demonstrator, 
and now in Horizon2020 (2015-2019) in a more extensive way.

In the current program Europlanet 2020, the 
[VESPA](http://www.europlanet-vespa.eu) (Virtual European Solar and Planetary 
Access) activity deals with the infrastructure and implementation new data 
services. VESPA supports all aspects of Solar System science. Its developments 
are building upon the standards of the 
[IVOA](http://ivoa.net) (International Virtual Observatory Alliance).

VESPA is proposing a consistent and comprehensive set of methods to 
distribute and search for data ressources. One of the main added value is its
unified interface to search for solar system data resources.

## VESPA: discovering and sharing

A new version of the [main VESPA query portal](http://vespa.obspm.fr) has 
recently been released. It provides direct access to all connected databases 
and the possibility to retrieve data files based on location, time, observing 
conditions, viewing geometry, etc. It also allows the user to easily examine 
and possibly analyze most data on-line with Virtual Observatory tools.

Currently 25 database are connected, covering all fields of Planetary Science, 
including surfaces, atmospheres, plasma, small bodies, exoplanets, etc, from a 
distributed network of data providers in 4 different European countries and Japan.

Some well attended services can be accessed this way, e.g., the [Encyclopedia of 
Exoplanets](http://exoplanet.eu) in Paris Observatory (~ 250,000 visits in 2016). 
Two other data services selected during the 2016 VESPA call are being connected 
and will be available in the coming weeks (from Granada and Kharkiv). In addition, 
one service from a network of amateur observers (RadioJove) has been installed. 

The number of data services available will rapidly grow in the coming year, as 
the VESPA Data Access Protocol (EPN-TAP v.2) has been adopted by ESA to provide 
access to its Planetary Science Archive, and is being studied by NASA and other 
space agencies. This system is also open to contributions from research teams. 
Teams which need support to implement their data service can apply to the 2017 
VESPA call next December. Selected teams will be invited to a 4 days workshop 
in Graz next March. 

The [SSHADE](https://blog.sshade.eu) activity is also proceeding towards a large 
public spectroscopy service. The database is being filled with laboratory 
measurements, and will be connected to the VESPA search interface later this 
year after validation.

Alternative access to VESPA-compliant data services is possible from VO tools 
such as [3Dview](http://3dview.cdpp.eu) and [CASSIS](http://cassis.irap.omp.eu), 
and an [EpnTAPClient java library](https://gitlab.irap.omp.eu/OV-GSO-DC/EpnTAPClient/tree/master) 
is available for developers.
